   A calm day begins in Seville. Mariano López goes to his job as sausage
   delivery man. Meanwhile, at Santiponce's interstratospheric device center,
   everybody is getting ready to the first fully Spanish rocket launch,
   designed by famous Dr. Torrebruno, an eminent nuclear physicist who had to
   leave the project prematurely, due to a strange mental disease. But nobody
   expected the rocket to suffer a sudden variation on its path, and falls
   right on the truck that Mariano López uses to transport a blood sausages
   cargo.

   Mariano, unconscious, lies on the floor besides his sausages and the
   truck's wreckage, spread all around. Some hours later, he wakes up really
   hungry, and eats an entire box of the radiated blood sausages. But... what
   the hell is happening!? Mariano is becoming different: Every muscle grows,
   he becomes taller, his ugly face becomes a pretty superhero's, Captain 'S',
   who discovers that everything was part of the evil Torrebruno's plan, with
   the true intention of ruling the World, starting by Seville.
